This morning, Youtube recommended me this video: [（音质修复版）反贼自媒体大v一个月到底能赚多少钱？为什么说它可能是一个比工作、炒股和房地产更靠谱的职业？](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4WyV6S7PW4)

The youtuber Bo Zeng is a software engineer and a China critic. In this video he analyzes another YouTuber [Torontobigface](https://www.youtube.com/@Torontobigface)'s content and monetization strategy. Bo's subtle irony has been a source of enjoyment since I started following him a few years ago.

Out of curiosity I had a look at Torontobigface's content. His videos are mostly focused on China, and suggests a limited understanding of modern political knowledge for someone who has lived in a democracy for many years, which is not surprising. In contrast to Torontobigface, another Chinese critic, [Anzhengming](https://www.youtube.com/@anzhengming), creates highly educational content that delves into the history and principles of democracy. However, despite Anzhengming's in-depth analysis, Torontobigface currently boasts a significantly larger following.

Bo didn't mention any of the above in his video - he mainly focus on Torontobigface's financial gain. I like to believe that this is Bo's way of self-deprecation. Another thing Bo didn't mention is his own initialtive of becoming a youtuber - youtube can be lucrative, but is it the right place for the kind of content he values and wants to create?

I'd like to follow his flow of his thoughts. YouTube's content often falls short of journalistic standards, then should I be investing my time in something more meaningful and fulfilling?

I thought about writing. Partially because youtube recommended me another video a few days ago - a young amateur writer was excited to share that a professor's Creative Writing courses was now free online. It did not make a lot impression initialtively, but now I am thinking about this video a lot. Unfortunaly I can't find it any more - I was searching this video and this professor's name in my youtube/browser history even Instgram history for hours but couldn't find it.

Maybe I can start to spend my time more wisely.

Wanted to read recently: The Banality of Evil by Hannah Arendt.
