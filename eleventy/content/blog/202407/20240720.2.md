> To make available evidence that does not support the case for the prosecution is usually the job of the defense, and the question why Dr Servatius, who perceived some minor inconsistencies in the testimony, did not avail himself of such easily obtainable and widely known documentation is difficult to answer. He could have pointed to the fact that Eichmann, immediately upon being transformed from an expert in emigration into an expert in ‘evacuation,’ appointed his old Jewish associates in the emigration business – Dr Paul Eppstein, who had been in charge of emigration in Berlin, and Rabbi Benjamin Murmelstein, who had held the same job in Vienna – as ‘Jewish Elders’ in Theresienstadt. This would have done more to demonstrate the atmosphere in which Eichmann worked than all the unpleasant and often downright offensive talk about oaths, loyalty, and the virtues of unquestioning obedience.

这本书读了三分之一，刷新我认知的是，一场世纪大审判的控辩双方的律师可以犯下多少显而易见的策略性的错误。在巨大的历史洪流中，顶尖的专业人士，在处理他们一生中最可能最重要的事务时，也是会频频犯错的。
更别提身处这场审判所讨论的事件中的人们了。非纳粹提拔的各级官员积极参与the final solution，犹太领袖参与屠杀自己的同胞，被屠杀的犹太人自己全程配合。当然，前两者的“错误”并不是因为人类理性的渺小，而是因为“the easing or the extinguishing of conscience”。

> I have dwelt on this chapter of the story, which the Jerusalem trial failed to put before the eyes of the world in its true dimensions, because it offers the most striking insight into the totality of the moral collapse the Nazis caused in respectable European society – not only in Germany but in almost all countries, not only among the persecutors but also among the victims.

这里作者把上述第三种情况--被屠杀的犹太人自己配合--也视为道德崩坏。我的理解是这样的，犹太社区本身也是有层级和架构的，每一个被屠杀的人都是有上级的。被投进毒气室的人在进去的前一刻对自己即将死亡可能是不知情的，而组织他进入集中营的犹太警察或者社区工作者在那一刻是知情的，只是他们可能不知道自己可能会是下一批。
