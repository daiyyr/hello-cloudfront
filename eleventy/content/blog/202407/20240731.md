Recently watched There's Still Tomorrow after seeing it recommended by YouTuber @suerlang. Despite knowing the plot beforehand, was deeply moved by the scene where the daughter hands the ballot to the mom. Delia's subsequent actions — forced to move forward with the crowd but turning back to gaze at Marcella — were incredibly powerful.

I believe the scene intended to offer solace to generations of women who endured patriarchal oppression, assuring them that their suffering has not been in vain. At the same time, it serves as a call to action for future generations, reminding us that the fight for feminism and democracy is far from over - "clench our ballots like love notes".
