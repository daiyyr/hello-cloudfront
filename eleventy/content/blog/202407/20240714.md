So the assassination happened.

Until now all reports I see from New York Times are about the assassination itself. 

Trump is already leading in poll after the debate. Now an obvious quetion is whether this failed assassination increase Trump's chance of winning the election further more. My guess is yes. In addtion, I think this will translate to increased influence after his potential victory.

Then, would he be able to become a dictator?

For a while, New York Times has been calling Trump a danger to democracy and I totally agree. In the following week, if New York Times stops calling him a danger, I will then start to worry.

I think someone made below comment about Abraham Lincoln (saying Lincol was being presisely progressive), which I think is also the paradox of all public relations practises: you can be a little bit ahead of the public, but you shouldnt be ahead too much. Is it another evidence that the most of the population are dumb? New york times, the gold standard of journalism in my mind, needs to show empathy to an assassination victim instead of immediatly dicussing the obvious consequences of this incident which will affect everyone's life. 

Or maybe they are just waiting for the confirmation that Democratic party is not behind the assassination.
