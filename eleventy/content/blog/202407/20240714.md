So the assassination happened.

Until now all reports I see from New York Times are about the assassination itself. 

Trump is already leading in poll after the debate. Now an obvious quetion is whether this failed assassination increase Trump's chance of winning the election further more. My guess is yes. In addtion, I think this will translate to increased influence after his potential victory.

Then, would he be able to become a dictator?

For a while, New York Times has been calling Trump a danger to democracy and I totally agree. In the following week, if New York Times stops calling him a danger, I will then start to worry.
