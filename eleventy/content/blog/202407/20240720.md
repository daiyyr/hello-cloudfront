This list focuses on words where one specific meaning lacks a direct translation in Chinese. Words with multiple meanings, each of which has a corresponding word in Chinese, are not included. For example, 'bat' has various definitions. While there's no single word in Chinese capturing all definitions of 'bat', it has corresponding words for each distinct meaning of 'bat'. Hence 'bat' is not in this list.
