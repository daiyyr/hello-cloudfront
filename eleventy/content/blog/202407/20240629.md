Eichmann in Jerusalem，读得很吃力，很多长句在看了翻译之后还需要读好几遍才能理解句子结构。

查了一下，Hannah这位德国作家是直接用英文写的这本书。当知道自己读的是原文而非翻译后，我更有兴趣读下去了。那些用来查单词的时间瞬间得到了justify。作者二十多岁逃出纳粹德国，之后移民美国：

- She fled Nazi Germany due to persecution in 1933. This was when she was 27 years old.
- However, she didn't settle permanently in the US until 1941, when she was 35 years old.
- Arendt was comfortable writing and thinking in both German and English.
- Some find her English clear and concise, particularly in "Eichmann in Jerusalem," which was originally written for The New Yorker. This might be due to editorial influence ensuring clarity for a broad audience. Others find her style complex and demanding, reflecting her German background and philosophical ideas.

当知道这些事实后，我越发觉得作者relatable。她的逃亡，她的理性，她的有条不紊。虽然才刚刚开始读第一本她的书，却有了久违的被灯塔照亮的感觉。

于是开始回忆并追问自己，为什么在知道以上事实以前，就选择了这本书。直接原因是安争鸣的视频推荐。可能我对庭审的兴趣、对德国人和犹太人模糊的好感 (比如如果当时以为作者是法国人, 可能就不会第一时间选这本书 ;) ）都是一部分原因。
