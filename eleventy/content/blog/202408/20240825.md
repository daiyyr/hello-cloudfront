Finished the book Never let me go. I feel the author's deep disappointment of humanity.

Like if you are as sensitive as Kathy - not the way Ruth was, who lived in self deception in almost all her life - and as Kathy, you look for the answser calmly and constantly - not like Tommy who was doing it in a presumptive way - then you always find this world full of "rubbish and debris", even if you have something as beautiful as love like Kathy and Tommy had.

When reading, I was sure that Madame was someone who leads some sort of rebellion, or at least she was fighting for students. I was sure that her fear of students was from a deep guilty. Then of course dispointed by how dark it turned out. The strongest resistance was not from Madame nor Miss Emily, but miss Lucy, and that was merely an effort to tell students a little bit more of truth.

When I was young, there is a period, maybe from 15 to 19 years old, I believed the darkest of humanity from the bottom of my heart. Then I met Lucy and everything changed. And then I came to New Zealand, since then I trust the society more and more. But today this book reminds me the dark, and you can argue the truth of humanity.
