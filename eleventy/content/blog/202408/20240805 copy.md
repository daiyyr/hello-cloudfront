Had this dream of living with Wen and Gui. Gui was gravely ill and nearing the end of life. Wen was taking care of her and his health was rapidly deteriorating due to the physical and emotional burden. Wen passed away not long after Gui.

I woke up realizing how the dream was a stark contrast to reality, as it was Wen who died first. Now I think the plot may be connected to the movie I watched the other day - I, Daniel Blake.

I always wanted to believe that Wen is morally perfect, is fragile in the face of life and can easily die for love.
